  <h3>Reflection</h3>
  <p> My finalized soundscape narrative consists of fourteen tracks, three being self-recorded, and the other eleven are from freesound.org.  Along with the screenshot of my final audacity project, I have uploaded four screenshots to highlight some of the effects I used.  The four I chose to highlight were, fade in/fade out, change speed, repeat, and change pitch.  I used the fade in and out to help make the soundscape flow together with no abrupt, loud changes.  I used the change speed effect to slow the footsteps recording because I wanted to portray a leisurely walk rather than a speed walk.  I then used the repeat effect on this same sound.  The sound I downloaded was only a few seconds, and I wanted to show a longer, slower walk to the beach.  The last effect I used was the change pitch, which I only used on the one sound of the coffee being stirred.  I did this to kind of slow down and give a more relaxed, deeper tone.  All of these effects helped me portray the theme/ambiance that I was aiming for. I tried to incorporate the use of effects but used them sparingly considering I was going for a very natural and relaxing tone. The soundscape I created is based on the experience of being down the shore with your family on vacation.  The narrative portrays waking up, making coffee, and heading straight down to the beach for a relaxing morning.  You can hear the chatter of the family inside making breakfast, and the calming noises of flipping the pages of a book while in the company of the calming morning waves.  I wanted to illustrate the bliss that I always remembered on vacation at the jersey shore. As I was imagining the experience I wanted to create, I was influenced by other morning routine soundscapes, but also, I was influenced by meditation tracks I had listened to before.  Often in guided meditation, it starts off with directions and dialogue, and then will slow down to allow your mind to drift off without you even noticing,  This is what I wanted to create with my soundscape: a very relaxing few minutes that ended with a period of time that someones mind could drift off and forget about any stress or tension.  I left the sound of the waves going for about a minute and a half with little interruption to end with the listener drifting off in relaxation.  That is what you get too do at the shore; there is no stress, just calming noises of the simplest things in the morning.  I wanted to bring this feeling often experienced at the shore to people who might an escape for a few minutes.  I hope the track is relaxing and somewhat nostalgic for the listeners.

<h3> Visual Argument Project: Advertisement for Supporting Local Businesses during the Pandemic </h3>

<h4> Reflection: </h4>
<p>
  When designing my visual argument, I wanted to address an issue related to the pandemic.  For my family personally, my dad being a restaurant owner and sole provider for our family, we struggled financially.  Small businesses everywhere were closing or going into debt due to being closed by the pandemic, and many did not have the same funds saved as larger corporations.  The purpose of my visual argument is to encourage buying products from small businesses rather than corporations.  I know that my design will not be able to cause everyone to shop small for every item they purchase, but the goal is to remind or change the mind of one person walking by so that maybe they will order from a local restaurant that night rather than from Chipotle, or McDonalds.  My audience is people who typically buy products from corporations.  In my design I used rhetorical strategies like visual rhythm, color balance, a flow of images, as well as an aspect of pathos.  My design consists of four images, all on different layers to show four examples of businesses that might have struggled during the pandemic.  They are all wearing their masks, and they each have one word at the bottom of their picture.  This creates visual rhythm as well as a flow of images. Although there are four images, it creates a simplistic and symmetrical design that is easy on the eye.  There is a similar color tone, which I created by adjusting the saturation and tone of each image; this hopefully created a more cohesive design.  Lastly, I added an aspect of pathos by including the business owners and their faces specifically.  Including faces adds an emotional aspect to design because the audience tends to feel differently than if there were only words supporting the cause. These strategies were achieved through cropping images, adjusting saturation, using the blur tool, as well as selecting and editing the appropriate font style. Overall, I hoped to create a simple and emotional design to encourage people to shop at small business through a time where they especially need the support.
