# WebPortfolioFinalforNow

This is the final for now version of my Web Portfolio.  I created this portfolio to use for Physician Assistant School applications to present all of my skills and experience.  This includes healthcare related experience as well as my skills in digital media and writing.  My plans for this site include touching up a few small details, like the footer.  I want to add the links to navigate the site on the footer as well.  Other than that, my site is finished.  I think the design and accessibility used will be effective in showing admissions offices my skills and experience.
