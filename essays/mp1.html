line-height:200%'>Analysis of Early Childhood Gender Constructs </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'>Many of us cannot
grasp the extent at which our surroundings shape who we are.  The media, our friends,
our education, and any experience with others induce our behaviors.  A large
contributor I did not mention is family.  I often see phrases on products,
online, or on TV such as “family over everything”. I have experienced and have
seen friends experience a stigma of going against or betraying your family’s
wants.  Although I see an importance in familial relationships, it is also
evident that the great power and influence a family has on someone truly shapes
an individual.  I have grown up in an environment where acting and behaving the
“correct” way was defined by others.  My parents had taught my siblings and I
to conform to what was acceptable to other families, our relatives, and the
media.  The most prominent and memorable construct I experienced was sexual
modesty for women.  My parents, siblings, aunts and uncles never talked about
sex with me.  Even recently, my parents will make comments or leave the room
during a sex scene of a movie.  They would mention that “they shouldn’t be
watching this with their daughter”.  Sex was taboo and should always be kept
private, even from your close family members.  My sexuality and romantic
relationships with others were kept out of conversations as I got older. It was
almost like they wanted to pretend like my sexuality didn’t exist.  Until I was
exposed to talking about sex with my friends and later my older sister, I
always kept to myself.  I never felt comfortable talking about my partners,
even if I was not necessarily having sex with them.  It was ingrained in my
mind that sex was shameful, and more importantly, shameful for women.  Part of
me understands that my parents don’t want to know every detail about my sex
life. However, I have shoved a lot of these feelings inside because I was raised
to think it shouldn’t be discussed.  My image exemplifies the theme that my
sexuality has been wedged further inside of me when being shaped by my
parents.  I have grown to realize that sex shouldn’t be seen as a negative act,
especially because someone is a woman. More importantly, this construct was
more destructive and dangerous than helpful, and I don’t want that to continue. 
Sex shouldn’t be something I am uncomfortable about or feel shamed for because
of my gender identity.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>            Going along with a
theme of modesty, I was taught women should keep their health and hygiene
private as well.  Natural aspects of a woman were shamed and were never discussed,
and if they were, it was brief and of necessity.  Whether this was talking
about periods, shaving, birth control, gynecology appointments, or sexual health,
my mom made it clear that people should never know about it.  It was
embarrassing to publicize such taboos. Even as I got older, it still felt like
women’s health was treated as if I was a child.  I felt embarrassed to ever
talk to my mom about it, even though I knew, growing up as a girl, everything I
was going through was completely natural.  Because of this, I never talked to
my mom about any sexual issues, my period, etc.  My freshman year of high
school, my doctor suggested that I go on birth control to improve and clear my
acne.  My mom was worried that people, specifically other parents and boys in
my school, would find out and treat me differently.  She said it was
“dangerous” because boys would find out and be sexually aggressive with me, as
if it was not my decision.  In general, women’s health issues were shamed and should
never be told to other people because they would assume immoral things about
you. Similar to sexual modesty, I can understand that women’s health isn’t a common
discussion topic, but I don’t think the way I was brought up was healthy either. 
Being shamed for being a woman conditioned me to think that I was “gross” or
that whatever issues I had were unnatural and should be ignored.  My sexuality
and concerns about women’s health were shoved inside. I felt like I was always
worried about if I would ever have to talk to my parents about it.  As I grew
up, more and more repressive constructs arose, and the shame built up inside of
me.  </p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'>            Because of these two
constructs, I started repressing my emotions altogether.  I typically see
through discourse like capitalism, education, and the media that women are
portrayed as more emotional than men. Through this discourse, I see women
playing the weaker role, and treated as lesser due to their assumed “emotional
instability”.   I think being pushed to be so private and modest made me take
on the masculine social construct, as seen in discourse, in terms of emotional
vulnerability. Being pushed to be sexually modest, I thought that people shouldn’t
see you being intimate or giving affection to others.  This applied even if it
wasn’t a sexual relationship.  I thought that no one should know about the
issues or drama going on in your life, sexual or not. This thought stemmed from
the pressure to conform to being perfect for other people.  I was brought up to
be reserved in almost every aspect of my personality.  I think this construct
has had the greatest effect on me and my behaviors.  In relationships, I tend
to overcompensate my insecurity of being emotionless by attaching myself to
males who are seen as the most emotional to others.  I think the reason for
this attachment is because I never experienced this vulnerability when I was
younger.  I couldn’t tell you the last time my parents said “I love you” to any
one of my siblings or I.  For this reason, many times I search for the most
emotive people, whether it be friends or romantic relationships, and hold onto
them. Even to this day, I feel pressured to keep a side of me private and
reserved to my family.  Being reserved has helped me in certain aspects of my
life: keeping calm when in a disagreement or in a serious educational situation. 
In contrast, it took a huge toll on my personality and my confidence.  Because
of this construct I don’t feel comfortable being vulnerable.  I want to change how
this construct affects me and try to gain the confidence to be sensitive and
unguarded.  I don’t know whether I want this because I want to “fit in” and conform
to the feminine roles I mentioned earlier, or because I just think it is
missing from my personality as a human being.  Regardless, I think that being
able to express emotions is imperative in any relationship, and for me that is
the greatest motivator for change.  These aspects of my environment have
created a pit inside of me.  Almost like there was a place for all the taboos
that were seen as shameful.  Because of my tendency to repress emotions, all of
these taboos were buried inside of me, so tightly packed it’s hard for me to
finally let them out.  </p>
