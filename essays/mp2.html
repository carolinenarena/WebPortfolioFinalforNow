<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;color:black'>It should be stated that
all transgender people should be treated equally and given the same
opportunities as any other human.  However, with the new conflict of
transgender women in sports, it is difficult to debate whether cisgender women
are at a biological disadvantage to transgender women pre full hormone
transition.  Transgender women shouldn’t be excluded from sports, but hormone
levels and a few other biologically advantageous factors should determine which
category of sports they participate in.  If they have the hormone levels of a
biological male, they should participate in men’s sports.   For these reasons,
I believe that individuals should participate with their biological sex at
birth. It is unarguable that women and men perform at different levels in
sports, and those advantages don’t go away post transition.  Looking at
professional records, for example the mile record holder.  For men, the world
record is 3:43, while the female’s world record is 4:12.  It is evident in this
situation and many other situations that men are able to outperform women.  On
average, women perform at a 10-12% lower ability than men.  There are many
factors that contribute to this including societal conditioning, testosterone,
etc.  Societal conditioning is a factor that is tied in with biological
abilities:  although it is not good to encourage males any more than females to
participate in sports, societal conditioning could possibly stem from the
biological factors that men obtain to perform at higher levels.  In addition, although
not true for all women, many women tend to have wider hips, smaller lungs, and
other biological factors that should be considered in comparing performances of
women vs men in physical activity.  Testosterone is commonly brought up and
supports male’s physical advantages because it does increase strength and
aerobic capacity.  Men, on average, have higher testosterone levels than women,
and create an advantage in activities like sports.  Pictured in this image is
Caster Semenya, a cisgender female who was not allowed to participate in the
Olympics due to her advantageous testosterone levels Because of this advantage,
many cisgender women in high school have a decreased chance in receiving
scholarships from colleges.  They have worked hard their whole lives, and many
pre transition transgender women that have started participating in women’s
sports have taken many of these scholarship offers.  Many of these girls start
practicing and devoting much of their time to a sport they are passionate
about.  They spend hours and hours perfecting their skills and training for a
sport, only to be disappointed when someone with a biological advantage takes
their spot.  This could also go for college athletes looking to participate in
professional sports as a career as well.  A main argument for creating a fair
environment for all genders comes from the idea of the skill thesis.  The skill
thesis states that a person’s success should come from skill and skill only. 
This means that there is no unequal advantages or unequal starting points in
any type of competition.  This could support why we separated sports into men’s
and women’s sports originally.  We accept that there are genetic differences
such as hormone levels that can affect how one performs in sports or any
physical activity through accepting the gender separation that already exists. 
This occurred so that we would be able to celebrate, and athletes would be able
to strive for success within their own gender.  If we didn’t separate sports
into these categories, many records overall are maintained by men.  Women would
be greatly unrepresented in many sports.   This is true for professional
sports, but also is true for high school levels sports.  Personally, I have
experienced seeing this divide in my high school career.  The best female 5K
times would be around 19:00, while male 5K times could be as fast as 15:30. 
This was not just my school either, going to meets all around the state, you
can gather that there is significant performance differences between males and
females in specifically cross country.  Cross country isn’t the only sport that
you notice this divide.  To further support the skill thesis, we see sports
like wrestling level out the playing field by performing in weight categories. 
To counter the argument that many sports don’t follow the skill thesis, I would
argue that actually some do.  Sports like wrestling recognize an unfair
advantage to factor like weight.  They level out the starting point in order to
truly determine success that depends on pure skill and hard work.  To support
the skill thesis, athletes should participate in the category of their
biological sex.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;color:black'>After bringing up this
topic to many of friends and family, I have heard one argument a few times that
has stuck with me.  It is this idea that men can just “choose” to become a woman
and use their biological advantages to gain success over cisgender women.  This
argument has stuck with me because many people arguing to exclude transgender
women from sports don’t understand that many of these women transitioning are
going through so much, both emotionally and physically if they are using
hormone or surgeries to transition.  The fact that people think cisgender men
are choosing to become women frustrates me.  Before going into further
arguments, I want to preface by asking you to put yourself in a transgender
women’s shoes.  Imagine, or relate if you have experienced these feelings, but
imagine that every day you feel that you are the wrong gender.  You are
suppressed into the gender constructs and taught to behave a certain way that
fits into your biological sex.  But what if you don’t feel like yourself in
those constructs.  What if you feel like you fit into another sex’s construct,
or what if you feel like you fit into both, or neither.  Transgender women are
not men who decide to become a woman.  Transgender women are women and
transgender men are men.  Although I am going to discuss mainly transgender
women, these beliefs and arguments are intended to support the equality of all
genders.  My whole point is to bring attention and sympathize with transgender
people as they are already facing a country who still has people advocating
against the rights of transgender people.  In my opinion, an unarguable point
supporting the participation of transgender people in all sports is </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;color:black'>Title IX.  Title IX
states “</span><span style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;color:black;
background:white'>[n]o person in the United States may, upon the basis of sex,
be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected
to discrimination under any education program or activity receiving federal
financial assistance”.    Regardless of your support of transgender athletes,
this law to end sex discrimination in schools was created in 1972, and should
still be followed and enforced in every aspect.  Although this covers only high
school and college athletes due to the wording “in schools”, I think it should
be enforced in professional sports as well.  Professional sports are careers,
and it is immoral to keep an individual from a job based on their gender
identity.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;color:black;background:white'>To
counteract the much-discussed testosterone argument, we have to recognize there
are so many factors that play a part in the success of one athlete to another. 
According to Sara Chodosh, a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania with a
degree in neuroscience and philosophy of science, there is no true correlation
of testosterone levels and performance levels.  She explains that there has
been no conclusive evidence of testosterone and its effects on women’s athletic
performance.  There are many factors ranging from societal conditioning to a
variety of hormones that can affect one’s athletic performance.  In order to
study testosterone, you have to look at natural hormone levels and compare them
to performance.  It is true that on average, cisgender men have higher levels
of testosterone levels than cisgender women.  However, if we use that data,
then we would also be able to conclude that on average, cisgender men with
higher testosterone levels would perform better than cisgender men who have a lower
level of testosterone, and that is not true. If testosterone truly did affect
athletic performance, we would be able to predict athletic performance of
someone based on their hormone levels.  There is not enough reliable and clear
evidence correlating performance with testosterone, so there should be no
argument that transgender women have an advantage over cisgender women due to
testosterone levels.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;color:black;background:white'>  </span><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;color:black'>As an alternative
solution to having the transgender individuals participate in athletics, we
could get rid of “womens” and “mens” sports as categories.  The categories
could be determined regardless of gender similar to wrestling where height, and
weight, biological advantages, are considered.  It is possible to create
categories depending on height, weight, and also a variety of hormone levels. 
This would also support an environment that accepted gender as fluid, allowing
people of all genders to participate in athletics while deconstructing the
gender binary at the same time.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%;color:black;background:white'>When
choosing to discuss transgender individual’s rights in athletics, I hadn’t
realized all of the complicated and conflicting arguments I had to consider.
While writing the attack, I found it really hard to find the words to explain
and convey an opinion that I didn’t truly believe.  I often would run out of
ideas and found it much harder to get into “a flow” of writing for the attack
compared with the defense.  In addition, after writing the attack, I had to
rethink all of my arguments for my defense.  While writing my defense I often
found myself wording arguments best so someone from the other side couldn’t
take it down.  Writing the attack first definitely strengthened my ideas and
how I conveyed them in my defense.  Ultimately, I  knew that I wanted to
support transgender’s rights to participate in the gender that they identified
with.  However, it was really hard for me to get past the evidence there is
supporting differences between male and female performances.  This was really
hard for me to get past because I was an athlete myself in high school.  Especially
in a sport like cross country, I can say from experience that I had trained
harder and longer than some of the men on the team.  However, my results didn’t
always show for that.  Many of the guys who didn’t care or didn’t train as hard
as I did still had race times similar if not better than mine.  I was
frustrated, but in the end their race time didn’t affect how well I ranked.  It
was really difficult to argue against this point, and it was the only point I
could relate to from the opposing side. I realized that the issue couldn’t be
solved by making laws that allowed transgender women and men to participate in
sports. These laws would just further support the gender binary that we have in
our country.  I think that having several categories to represent the gender
spectrum that we are pushing towards will more likely help everyone as a whole.</span></p>
