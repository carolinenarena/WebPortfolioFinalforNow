<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;
line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Living in a
world during a pandemic and having instantaneous access to medical knowledge
through the internet can be unsettling.  I’m sure that many of us can relate to
experiencing a unique symptom, looking it up, and finding the worst-case
scenario on WebMD.  We are overloaded with medical data and claims, and it can
be disorienting trying to sort through it all.  For many of us, we seek out a
physician in times of uncertainty, searching for the most accurate answer to
our problems from the “experts”.  The trouble is, the experts don’t always seem
to know the answer or worse, they might give us the wrong one.  Over the course
of history, physicians have gained authority and prestige while patients have
been dismissed. In <i>Health and Rhetoric of Medicine</i>, Judy Segal analyzes
several aspects of biomedicine throughout history and its effects today.  In
chapter one Segal writes: “The emerging authority of physicians came only in
part from the measurable benefits of their treatments.  Their authority came
also from the work of professional inclusion and exclusion performed by guilds
and organizations of allopathic physicians” (Segal 32). She discusses the
concept of clinicians being the most “fit” for practice when the empirical gaze
was introduced.  The concepts of empiricism and authority support the hierarchy
between the clinician and the patient.  She adds, starting in the nineteenth
century, Fissell argued “doctors began to sound like doctors, and patients’
voices disappear” (Segal 29).  Rhetorical symbols emerged; white coats and
stethoscopes established power and knowledge in each clinician’s practice. However,
the authority behind clinicians should not dismiss the thoughts and experiences
of each patient.  Why do we value opinions supported by authority more than
those without?  Does having authority deem someone’s opinion more objective? Why
are the patient’s self-recorded symptoms often disregarded if they are not
physically seen?  A stream of questions surface when debating whose judgement
has the most validity.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;
line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            When
analyzing whether the patient or the clinician should be valued more in medical
practice, I think it is important to question how objectivity plays into what
makes a perspective valuable.  Does having authority make your opinion more
objective? Does being “objective” even help to provide the best medical care? 
Before comparing the patient and the clinician, we must understand that
throughout history, being objective was thought to be an important factor in
finding truth.  Medicine aims to find truth in science.  Clinicians want to
find one singular answer or diagnosis to each problem. In <i>Objectivity</i>,
Stephen Gaukroger discusses how one definition of objectivity: accurate
representation, “strengthens and secures the justification requirement (in
scientific knowledge), not because it has anything to do with the truth
requirement” (Gaukroger 9).  We are all able to use forms of objectivity to
justify an opinion, but this singular truth that we strive for in medicine is
often hard to find.  Moreover, being objective is not the medium to finding
truth.  This point is important when thinking about whose opinion to validate. 
Being objective and using knowledge from one’s expertise supports the
justification of one’s perspective, but it doesn’t prove truth of their
perspective.  Additionally, there is not one perspective that is always
“true”.  Often, more than one opinion can have truth.  This concept can be hard
to acknowledge, especially in medicine. Clinicians want to find the best and
most accurate answer.  Patients want to find the most helpful treatment.  The
problem is, there is rarely a time when one treatment is agreed to be the
“best”.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;
line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Although not
always correct, the clinician is most times more knowledgeable than the
patient.  There are reasons why people specialize in one career or one field.  The
more training and education on a subject is thought to make you more capable to
make decisions in that field.  I don’t want to discredit doctors and the
immense training they endure.  Doctors complete anywhere from eleven to fifteen
years of training before they are able to practice as an attending in their
chosen specialty.  Biomedicine has been used to empirically treat and diagnose
patients.  An important aspect of any practice is certainty; “the textual
markers of certainty, for example, are tied to conventions of medial authority;
statistical argumentation plays out the scientific bent of biomedicine; the
inquiring mind is a trope aimed at securing professional cooperation, and so
on” (Segal 2).  For centuries, empiricism has been used in medicine to be
“certain” of knowledge.  The “statistical argumentation” used illustrates how previous
data can support one theory or another. Previous patient cases can be used as
learning opportunities in attempts to provide a better treatment plan for the
next patient.  Does that mean that clinicians can be entirely certain about
each diagnosis? No, but there is thoughtful consideration supported by data behind
each decision. The difference between the clinician’s opinion and the patient’s
opinion is not objectivity, but authority and expertise. Both are entitled to
their opinions, but that does not mean that we disregard the superior knowledge
of doctors. When discussing compliance and trust of a clinician, Segal notes in
chapter seven, “Physicians must have genuinely superior knowledge in medical
matters.  Otherwise, on what basis would they be qualified to practice
medicine?... Expertise itself is not the problem.  It is a resource” (Segal
142-143). Although there are several issues with medical diagnosis, the
knowledge clinicians have should be used in making an informed decision.  Rather
than seeing the clinician’s opinion as an authoritative order, the clinician
should be used as a resource in a patient-clinician alliance.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;
line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            Without
taking any legitimacy from the clinician, I question whether the patients’
perspective is any less reliable.  When a clinician makes the call on one’s diagnosis,
does the patient have the right to disagree? Are the patient’s own experienced
symptoms and self-diagnosis any less accurate?  Although their opinion is not
supported by years of training and education, it can be argued that their
opinion is imperative in medical care.  Stephen Gaukroger discusses authority
and its inaccurate direct relationship with reliability.  He recognizes the
idea of accumulating information from a variety of perspectives rather than
deeming the most authoritatively supported argument as “true”.  He analyzes
Wikipedia against other sources that advertise their authority:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-left:.5in;line-height:200%'><span
style='font-size:11.5pt;line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>One
thing at issue here is the question of authority.  On the face of it, the
contrast is between reference sources written by people identified as
authorities, and those written simply by people who have an interest in the
subject.  But there is something misleading about this contrast…. For it to
work as a reference source, we do not want to know what anybody at all thinks,
but what someone who is well-informed about the subject matter thinks.  And we
want what that person writes to be balanced.  Well informed and balanced
articles are wheat, in the main, we get in Wikipedia, and this is what helps make
it the single most consulted reference source throughout the world (Gaukroger 15).</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;
line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Gaukroger identifies that
Wikipedia is a source where people who don’t have the credentials are able to
share their perspective and opinions on issues.  They are able to share what
they might have learned from other friends or family members rather than knowledge
from their structured education.  Gaukroger notes that Wikipedia is “well
informed and balanced”; there is a variety of sources and ideas, and that the accumulation
and diversity of ideas is where we are able to find the most valuable
information.  This idea relates to the patient-clinician alliance Segal
discussed in chapter seven.  Regardless of credentials and authority, the
patient’s perspective is just as valuable as the clinicians.  Following
Gaukroger’s theory, gathering the opinions of several doctors, patients, and
their family members would result in balanced and well-informed information in
which decisions could be made from.  </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-size:11.5pt;
line-height:200%;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>            From
analyzing both perspectives in medical practice, I find the concept of a
patient- clinician alliance beneficial.  Rather than a hierarchical system
where one opinion is valued the most, an environment where critique and
discussion are present could be worthwhile in medicine.  In the last pages of <i>Health
and Rhetoric of Medicine</i>, Segal reflects on how “we should trust physicians
themselves to act on their best knowledge, and we should act on our best
knowledge, too” (Segal 152).  She acknowledges how we as patients should credit
those with more training, but not to forget our own knowledge and instincts
either.  While analyzing Segal and Gaukroger’s texts, I was hoping to find some
kind of answer to my opening questions.  As someone who aspires to find a
career as a Physician Assistant, this issue is immensely significant.  At what
point do I trust my own opinion over my patients? Or vice versa.  If I do
accumulate a variety of opinions, how do my patient and I decide which treatment
to use? In a field where ambivalent answers are not rewarded, the fact that I
am only able to offer a deeper understanding is frustrating.  Like in medicine,
there are not always resolutions, and accepting inconclusively is hard.  Analyzing
different perspectives on this issue, however, did help me in understanding a
new way of gathering information.  Not only are my physicians’ and teachers’
perspectives valuable, but so are my own.  My peers are able to justify their
opinion in the same way that our professors are.  In one sense, this gives me a
new confidence in my own views as well as an appreciation for those views who
might not have the highest credentials.  In another sense, it has grounded me. 
I hope to remember this when I am a Physician Assistant and understand that despite
not having authority or expertise in medicine, my patient’s experiences and
opinions are just as valuable as my own.  This leveling of hierarchies is so
significant in today’s world as we get more competitive and autonomous in our
culture.</span></p>
