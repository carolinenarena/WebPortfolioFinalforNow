State Court: Rape Defined</span></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in;
line-height:200%'><span style='color:#333333'>            In many states, there
are no legal consequences for the act of marital rape.  Looking specifically at
Oklahoma’s state law defining rape, its discourse allows people guilty of
committing marital rape to stay out of the court room. The following passage is
the active law used and analyzed for all cases of potential rape convictions. 
Because this law is still used today, my revisions are even more so needed of
attention.  The diction used in this law as well as some other state’s rape
defining laws are unacceptable. Similar laws can be found in states such as
North Carolina. Besides the point, many states and other countries are able to
have active laws that does not recognize that consent is still required in
marital sex.  In the following passage, I want to highlight the dismissal of
marital rape, the inadmissible support of a gender binary, and a few other
issues included in Oklahoma’s current law defining rape: </span></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in'><i><span
style='color:#333333'>A. Rape is an act of sexual intercourse involving vaginal
or anal penetration accomplished with a male or female who is not the spouse of
the perpetrator and who may be of the same or the opposite sex as the
perpetrator under any of the following circumstances:</span></i></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in'><i><span

the accused in collusion with the spouse with intent to induce that belief. In
all cases of collusion between the accused and the spouse to accomplish such
act, both the spouse and the accused, upon conviction, shall be deemed guilty
of rape;</span></i></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in'><span
class=apple-converted-space><i><span style='color:#333333'>…</span></i></span></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in'><i><span
style='color:#333333'>B. Rape is an act of sexual intercourse accomplished with
a male or female who is the spouse of the perpetrator if force or violence is

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in'><i><span

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in;
line-height:200%'><span style='color:#333333'>            Specifically looking
at clause A of the Oklahoma State Law, Section 1111- rape Defined, they state
rape as an act of “vaginal or anal penetration”.  Only mentioning vaginal or
anal penetration is restrictive and keeps the court from being able to
prosecute anyone who has forced oral sex or any other sexual act on a person
regardless of penetration.  Is this law saying forced oral sex within a marriage
or not is without consequence? Is this law saying violence and sexual intimacy
without consent is legal as long as penetration does not occur? It is important
to acknowledge that there is a multitude of situations better fit the true
definition of rape.  Ultimately, the severity is only experienced by the
victim.  For that reason, I think it is completely unreasonable to determine
rape by penetration.  The trauma and fear a rape victim goes­­ through are
still present whether anal or vaginal penetration has occurred.  I would change
this clause to be more inclusive of all sexual acts that have occurred without
consent between all partners.  </span></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in;
line-height:200%'><span style='color:#333333'>            The clause continues
by stating that penetration must be “accomplished with a male or female”.  The
law excludes all intersex and trans bodies, as well as anyone that doesn’t
identify with any gender.  All of these people excluded are capable of being
victims or perpetrators of rape.  The diction of only “male or female” is
supporting our country’s gender binary.  The support of a gender binary is
present through discourse in the media, books, shows, articles, etc. Not only
is the gender binary enforced as a social construct but here it is reinforced
in the court room.  Because of the terminology “male or female”, for example, an
intersex person is capable of committing or being a victim of rape without
consequences. Later in this phrase, it states rape is between “same or opposite
sex”.  The law assumes there are two opposite genders, and further supports the
gender binary.  There is a diversity of gender identities, and none of them are
so called “opposites” of each other.  Because of the reinforced gender binary,
the law excludes intersex, trans, and people who don’t identify with any
gender.</span></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in;
line-height:200%'><span style='color:#333333'>            The last phrase in Clause
A that I want to highlight is “who is not the spouse of the perpetrator”.  The
word “spouse” refers to the person married to the perpetrator.  Clause A
dismisses the existence of marital rape. Because of clause A, rape with or
without the use of violence, drugs, etc. is completely legal between partners
who are married, even when consent is not given by all partners.  Not only does
it completely disregard marital rape when both partners are sober, but as the
law continues and explains that when<i> “the victim is intoxicated by a
narcotic or anesthetic agent”</i>, only if it is not the victim’s spouse. Regardless,
the diction used neglects the bottom line that sober and active consent must be
given each and every time despite the status of any relationship. </span></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in;
line-height:200%'><span style='color:#333333'>            Later we see lawmakers
added Clause B that states that rape can occur between spouses in a marriage if
“force of violence is used or threatened”.  Although this is an improvement by
recognizing marital rape </span><span style='color:black'>exists, unfortunately,
it is only recognized </span><span style='color:#333333'>as rape if violence is
used.  This does not include the use of drugs, forcing sex onto a spouse while
unconscious or asleep, or even just sex without active consent.  Rape does not
have to occur with violence.  There are many instances where violence is not used.
Why should it be any different for a couple who is married?  Sex should still
be consensual.  There is no vow or marriage law that states that sex should no
longer need to be consensual.  No matter the relationship, sex without active
consent, should be tried in court and recognized as rape.  It should be noted
that I specifically use “active consent”.  Active consent includes the right of
a partner to take back consent at any point during sexual intercourse. </span></p>

line-height:200%'><span style='color:#333333'>            The main goal of the
revision was to include all genders, all situations, and all relationships in
being potential victims or perpetrators of rape.  It is easy to unintentionally
leave out certain groups or situations, especially in 1981 when the law was
written. The diction we use today, is very different from the diction used in
1981.  Intersex bodies, trans people, people who don’t identify with a gender,
marital rape, active consent, etc. are all people and situations we are more conscious
of including today.  Although the word choice of Oklahoma’s definition of rape
might seem acceptable in 1981, the fact that this exact law is still used in
courtroom’s today is unacceptable.  </span></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in;
text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span style='color:#333333'>The lawmakers in
Oklahoma blatantly exclude many people and situations in the active version of
the law above.  It is so important that we recognize and accept all genders,
all relationships, and all situations.  The previous analysis is not of an
article, or a movie, it is of a law that is used to decide whether someone is
convicted of rape or not.  Judges analyze and use each and every word to
consider the outcome of a trial.  Because of the exclusion of many genders and
situations, people’s lives are greatly affected.  Rapists are able to get off
free through loopholes in Oklahoma’s law.  The revisions I made such as <i>between
people in any type of relationship, including none at all and who may be of the
same or different sex </i>made the diction vaguer, but now is able to include
everyone and allow them to get the justice or repercussions.  As people, we
have to start paying greater attention to each word we use, in particular in
the diction of active laws, because it is inappropriate and inadmissible to
continue to exclude people from the same rights as others.  </span></p>

<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:7.5pt;margin-left:0in;
text-indent:.5in;line-height:200%'><span style='color:#333333'>The vagueness
that was added has benefitted the law in this situation.  A new law supported
by the Prime Minister of Sweden has arose following the rise of the # MeToo
Movement in the US.  Sweden has moved to define rape simply as “sex without
consent”.  The idea of a vaguer definition for rape was brought to attention by
a small political group in Sweden called FATTA.  In the sixth clause I used
wording like Sweden’s law in attempt to include all situations of rape.  I also
added a seventh clause to specify that consent needs to be active, meaning that
consent can be taken back at any point of sexual intimacy.  If consent is taken
back and perpetrator continues, this would also be considered rape. Being
unclear with word choice does not always mean a more inclusive law.  It is
important to determine the meaning of laws in specific situations.  However, it
is practically impossible to include every rape situation out there.  For that
reason, vaguer word choices are beneficial in defining rape in the practice of
law.  This approach to law using ambiguous diction could be the next step in
improving our country’s ability to convict more cases of rape that occur.</span></p>
